		<h2> Design #1</h2>
		<p> I like this website design as it's very unique. Upon entrance, a robot illustration emerges from behind a semi transparent background which contains the page's main content, all in front of a spinning illustration in the very background.
			I believe that I know how this 'movement' on the page is achieved, but let's first observe the basics: </p>
		<ul> 
			<li> - The large header was given a new font in CSS, enlarged, then restyled with a new color. If any other &lt;h1&gt;'s were used on the web page, then the main header at the top was specifically targeted using an ID.</li>
			<li> -  All paragraphs seem to be styled the same on this page. This means that the CSS documents targets the paragraphs by simply using a &lt;p&gt; tag.</li>
			<li> -  All of the links on the page are also styled the same way with an exception of a few. The few that were intended to be designed differently than the other must have been put in a class to 'override' the previous design that was given to them.</li>
		</ul>
		<p> The main moving elements of the page are illustrations that used a &lt;img&gt; tag to be brought into the site, however they are styled with CSS. First, they we're put in the far back by being assigned a z-index to them, one in front of the other. I think the movement upon loading the web page is done by using the 'transition: ' property. On page load, the illustration is transitioned to move closer to the top of the page. <span> Similar to the example (on hover): </span> </li>
		<div id = 'box'></div>
		<ul id = 'nav'>
			<li><a href = 'zen-garden-design-1.html'>Design 1</a></li>
			<li><a href = 'zen-garden-design-2.html'>Design 2</a></li>
			<li><a href = 'zen-garden-design-3.html'>Design 3</a></li>
		</ul>
